# ArduNet
ArduNet is an android application designed to graph sensor data using BLE (bluetooth low-energy). 

# Features
* Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices
* Record sensor data (x,y) into .csv format
* Export .csv files to Gmail, Outlook or Google Drives

# Code
## Set up Service and Characteristic
Set your Bluetooth device to transmit the packet under the following default service and characteristic UUID.  The app will only display data if it matches these UUIDs.
* Service UUID: `4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b`
* Characteristic UUID: `beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8`

## Characteristic Packet Format
Broadcast the BLE packet with the following packet format\
`AXXX/BXXX/CXXX/DXXX/EXXX/FXXX/GXXX/HXXX/IXXX/JXXX/KXXX/LXXX/MXXX`\

Each packet is delimited using a `/` character and is uniquely identified by a letter ranging from A to M.  \
`XXX` represents the value associated with the letter ID.

A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M
